# React.js random color generator

This is a small program to generate random hexadecimal colors using react.js components. It is mainly built to illustrate many forms different components can use to communicate with each other, mainly sibling components.

Methods of communication used:

- Props
- Context API

Each will be found in its own branch of the repository.

## Utilizing the props method

The props method is the standard method of communication, it is a direct connection between parent and child components. The parent component will pass information to the child component as *props* and the child can use these props to alter their parent. 

Knowing this, we can make sibling components communicate using their parents as an intermediary.
